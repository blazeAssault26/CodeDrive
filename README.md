# CodeDrive: Self-Driving Car Simulation

Welcome to CodeDrive, a comprehensive Self-Driving Car Simulation entirely built in JavaScript. This project faithfully replicates real-world challenges, including road definitions, lane management, collision detection, and realistic traffic simulation.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Simulation Environment**
  - The simulation mirrors real-world scenarios, addressing challenges like road definitions, lane management, collision detection, and realistic traffic simulation.

- **Neural Network Integration**
  - The car's "brain" is enhanced through neural networks, incorporating mutations for adaptive learning and improved decision-making over time.
