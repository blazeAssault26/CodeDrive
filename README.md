# CodeDrive:
I have successfully developed an autonomous car driving simulation powered by neural networks. The simulation features a realistic virtual environment with integrated sensors to detect potential collisions.
The neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm, enabling the car to make informed decisions while navigating the environment.
Implemented visualization methods provide insights into the neural network's learning process, improving driving decisions by identifying patterns from data.
