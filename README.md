# CodeDrive: Autonomous Car Driving Simulation

## Overview

Welcome to CodeDrive, an autonomous car driving simulation powered by neural networks. This project offers a realistic virtual environment equipped with integrated sensors designed to detect potential collisions.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network-Based Decision Making**
    - The heart of CodeDrive is a neural network trained using the backpropagation algorithm. This enables the car to make informed decisions while navigating the complex virtual environment.

- **Visualization for Enhanced Learning**
    - Implemented visualization methods provide valuable insights into the neural network's learning process. These visualizations help identify patterns from data, enhancing the car's decision-making capabilities and driving performance.
